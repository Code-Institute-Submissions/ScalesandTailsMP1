# Scales and Tails
# Reptile Information

This website is about a hobby i am passionate about, reptiles. I want to show people that reptiles can be kept as pets 
I personally have had reptiles since i was younger and always found them facinating from lizards to snakes, Alot of people 
that dont like reptiles say they dont show any affection to there owners but in fact these people are wrong as i have snakes and 
lizards which all have there own personality and affection to me as there owner. I have crested geckos which when they see me in the room thet come
straight over to tank and look out at me to see what im doing and and a leopard gecko that give me kisses. I also have snakes that hear me when im in the room they will come to the glass of the tank and wait for me to take them out.
they do know the differences between food and there owner as the same as a dog or cat. if you treat an animal with repect and the handling and care they know you and trust you.

I personally done this to show people the side of reptiles that they dont know and hopefully help people with there fears and show them  a softer side of reptiles and show them before getting a reptile research them 
as alot of reptiles are bought when they are nice and small and when they get bigger they get tossed aside and mistreated, due to no fault of there own which we similar see with dogs and other animals 
which is not fair to them.
