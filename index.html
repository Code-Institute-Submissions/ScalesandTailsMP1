            <img src="/assets/images/lexi.jpg" >
            <p>This photo is one of the reptiles that i rescued a bearded dragon. She was 4 years old wasnt kept in proper tank or given proper calcium and vitamins she needed
                she had mbd which is short for metabolic bone disease due to lack of sufficent heat, food and vitamins. This is a good picture of her eating butternut squash her favourite after trying to get her back to health 
                but unfortunatly she had to be put to sleep as the disease ended up with her losing her ability to walk it was horrible and sad time because if she had been given the proper care all her 4 years before i rescued 
                her she would have lived up to 15 years. This is another reason people need to do there research on animals before buying as this is happening every day which it should not be as all animals deserve to be treated with care.
