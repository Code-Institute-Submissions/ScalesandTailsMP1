                        Leopard geckos are one of the most popular geckos to be kept as pets as they are classed in the reptile community as a beginner's pet.
                        they live up to around 15 years or more in captivity and are very docile and friendly lizard. In the wild they are found throughout asia and some other countries,
                        there is multiple morphs (colours and patterns) ranging from black to white, they also have a defence mechanism which is when under threat from a 
                        predator or if the animal is stressed they drop there tail which distract's the predator long enough for them to get away, also their tail regrows 
                        but not the same as before but in a bulb like shape. leopard geckos are a solitary animal which they like living alone unless they are mating, otherwise they are best kept apart 
                        as fighting would occur. They eat a varied diet of insects which include crickets, morioworms, dubia roaches and others but these insects have to be dusted in calcium power with d3 
                        so they are getting there vitamins and calcium in captivity and in the wild they hunt for there food at night while it is cooler than the day. They store excess fat in there tails so when food is shortage in the wild the fats stored in the tail get them by until they find more food.

                Corn snakes are a one of the best beginner snakes to have as a pet. These snakes can live up to 25 years in captivity and are a very friendly snake that rarely shows any sign of aggression. These snakes come from all over USA and In my own experience with these snakes they are very food motivated and they never refuse prey.
                This type of snake varies in many different regions and in captivity they have a lot of various colours and patterns that do not occur in the wild. 
                The length of this snake can grow upwards of 6 foot. The females are smaller than the males. In captivity they are know to be escape artists. They eat a 
                varied diet of small rodents including mice,rats and chicks occasionally. Depending on the prey size they eat a smaller rodent once a week and if prey item is bigger they can go without eating for a fortnight.
                When in brumation a corn snake can go without food for couple of months. Females lay eggs and can have a clutch size from 6 and can go any where upwards of 20+.
