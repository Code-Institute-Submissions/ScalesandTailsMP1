                        Leopard geckos are one of the most popular reptiles to be kept as pets,As they classed in the reptile communitys as a beginner's pet.
                        they live up to around 15 years in captvity and are very docile and friendly lizard. In the wild they are found throughout asia and some other countries,
                        there is multiple morphs (colours and patterns) ranging from black to white, they also have a defence mechanism which is when under threat from a 
                        predator or if the animal is stressed they drop there tail which distracts the predator long enough for them to get away, also their tail regrows 
                        but not the same as before but in a bulb like shape. leopard geckos are a solitary animal which they like living alone unless they are mating, otherwise they are best kept apart 
                        as fighting would occur. they eat a varied diet of insects which include crickets, morioworms, dubia roaches and others but these insects have to be dusted in calcium power with d3 
                        so they are getting there vitamins and calcium in captivity which they store excess fat in there tails. If you want to learn more about this repile follow this link to a wikipedia page about them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_leopard_gecko">Read more</a>
